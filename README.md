# TodoApp
Hey, this is an App for managing my own life. You're welcome to contribute to my Project, download it for youself or improve the App! 

My plan is to bring the app into the PlayStore for free and __without__ ads.

# Contribute:
If you'd like to improve the App, then feel free to contribute. Your name and social media will be displayed in the `Settings` -> `Credits` Section with a Link attached for what you want (Fiverr, Github...).

# State
I am using `MVVM-Pattern`, except the Bottom Sheet, because the `DataBinding` isn't working well.
